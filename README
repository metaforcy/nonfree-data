This archive contains the code for the nonfree datatype package and examples.

The package works with Isabelle2013.  The specific keywords are in the file 
isar-keywords-nonfreedata.el, which needs to be copied to Isabelle2013/etc/ before running 
the examples.  If using Proof General, the kewwords need to be loaded explicitly, e.g.:  

         isabelle emacs -k nonfreedata FSets_Bags.thy

The examples from the paper (including the appendix) are located in theories with suggestive names.
