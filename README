This archive contains the code for the nonfree datatype package and examples.

The package works with Isabelle2013.
If you use ProofGeneral to process the examples you have to copy
isar-keywords-nonfreedata.el into Isabelle2013/etc/ 
and then start Isabelle with:

         isabelle emacs -k nonfreedata FSets_Bags.thy

The examples from the paper (including the appendix) are located in theories with suggestive names.    


The package depends on the infrastructure for algorithmic rule systems and forward rules
in ../metarec/ which is also contained in the archive.
