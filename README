This archive contains the code for the nonfree datatype package and examples.

TODO for Andy: Instructions on how to run it, Isabelle2013, etc.

The examples from the paper (including the appendix) are located in theories with suggestive names. 

TODO for Andrei: Explain the "interpretedas" discrepancy with the paper.  



works with Isabelle-2013
and needs correspondingly updated ../metarec/ repository


needs isar-keywords-nonfreedata.el  in Isabelle2013/etc/
  (this is probably not the official solution?)
start tests with isabelle emacs -k nonfreedata


batch test via 
  isabelle usedir -C false -b -v true HOL InstanceTerms.thy
  (probably changed with Isabelle-2013)
