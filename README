This archive contains the code for the nonfree datatype package and examples.

The package works with Isabelle2013.

Some proofs use the Z3 SMT solver. To activate it you have to set
    Z3_NON_COMMERCIAL="yes"
in the environment or in "$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings" (see also
contrib/z3* subdirectory of your Isabelle installation). This implies
that you should not use Z3 for commercial purposes.  In case you are
interested in commercial use of our package please let us know.

If you use ProofGeneral to process the examples you have to copy
isar-keywords-nonfreedata.el into Isabelle2013/etc/ 
and then start Isabelle with:
    isabelle emacs -k nonfreedata FSets_Bags.thy

The examples from the paper (including the appendix) are located in theories
with suggestive names.    


The package depends on the infrastructure for algorithmic rule systems and
forward rules in ../metarec/ which is also contained in the archive.
